Cheating Essentials
==================

<code>Taking over CheatingEssentials for Kodewaga</code>


<i>How this mod works:</i>

It works by loading 'modules' that do different things; each module has methods therein that are called when different Forge events are fired. This functionality is in the base Module class, and every module uses this as its superclass. I currently have world rendering, GUI overlay rendering, and ticking, but I'll add more as needs be. Modules automatically override the world render/tick methods, but, generally, only one will be used. There's also a GUI render method in there, but that's not an abstract method, as I added it in kinda late, as well as the fact that many modules will simply never use it. Built against Forge 10.12.0.1024
